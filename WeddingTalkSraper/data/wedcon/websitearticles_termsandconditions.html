				<p>Supplier Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>Wedding Connections General Terms and Conditions for Suppliers</p>
<p>WEDDING CONNECTIONS Supplier TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;These terms and conditions (the &ldquo;Supplier Ts &amp; Cs&rdquo;) govern the relationship between&nbsp;Wedding Connections Pvt Limited, who owns the site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.weddingconnections.lk/"  >www.weddingconnections.lk<img border="0" alt="www.weddingconnections.lk" src="https://www.weddingconnections.lk/components/com_sh404sef/images/external-white.png"/></a>, of, 47/15 Ward Place, Colombo 7, Sri Lanka. (&ldquo;Provider&rdquo;)&nbsp;and any owner of services available through the website (&ldquo;Supplier&rdquo;).</p>
<p>(2) The Supplier Ts &amp; Cs&nbsp;constitute a legally binding agreement&nbsp;between the Provider and the Supplier; each Supplier who&nbsp;uses or accesses this site agrees to the&nbsp;Supplier Ts &amp; Cs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) The Provider does not authorise anyone&nbsp;to register with this site unless they are able to enter into legally binding contracts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; REGISTERING A PROFILE&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;This site is a place where wedding&nbsp;Suppliers can advertise&nbsp;one or more of their services (each a &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) for hire to potential customers, and communicate with those potential customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We refer to actual and potential customers, whether of the Supplier&rsquo;s or other Services, as &ldquo;Customers&rdquo;. Suppliers advertise on the Provider&rsquo;s site by registering a profile (&ldquo;Profile&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;The Provider is not, and does not become, party to any contractual relationship between the Customer and the Supplier, and does not mediate between the Customer and the Supplier in the event of any dispute arising between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The site is a platform for Suppliers and Customers to interact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) To register a Profile, the Supplier&nbsp;is obliged</p>
<ul>
<li>to enter required details (such as name, contact details, service offered, prices, locations covered) on the site&rsquo;s online form;</li>
<li>to accept these Terms &amp; Conditions;</li>
<li>to agree to pay to the Provider the fee for listing on&nbsp;the website (&ldquo;Listing Fees&rdquo;) and any other fees levied by the Provider;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The current version of the Profile has additional functionality to enable the Supplier to add audiovisual samples, in order to enhance prospects for sale to prospective customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) All banking and other fees relating to undisputed or disputed payments shall be borne by the Supplier. Credit Card number and entry of username and password are via 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) The Provider reserves the right to decline to place any Profile that appears, at the Provider&rsquo;s discretion, to be capable of infringing, or be associated with the infringement of, any provision of these Supplier Ts &amp; Cs.</p>
<p>3. THE DASHBOARD AND CUSTOMER REVIEWS&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;Through registration,&nbsp;a Supplier is given&nbsp;a Supplier profile in which the data he/she contributes is recorded and in which all the Services offered by that Supplier are specified (the &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) In the Dashboard, the Supplier will have various functions available which are intended to assist the Supplier to manage services offered through the site, to track the number of visits by prospective Customers and the number of enquiries, and to keep the Registered Profile updated.&nbsp; These functions, and the Dashboard itself, are made available on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis, and the Provider does not undertake that the Dashboard or its functions will be complete or error-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;Customers may post their own reviews of Suppliers Services (&ldquo;Customer Reviews&rdquo;) on the site. The Supplier is given the opportunity to view Customer Reviews, and to respond to them (a &ldquo;Supplier Response). Please note that the Provider does not, and does not realistically have the ability to, verify the accuracy or otherwise of Customer Reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;The Provider requires all Supplier Responses to be written by the supplier of the service or his/her authorised representative, and may decline to post any of them that the Provider finds does not do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any Customer Comment, Customer Review or Supplier Response appears on the site but fails to conform to the Content Guidelines, then without prejudice to any other available remedies, the Provider shall be entitled immediately to remove from the site the relevant non-conforming Customer Comments, Customer Reviews and Supplier Responses.</p>
<p>4. PROFILE DETAILS AND SERVICES&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) The Supplier&rsquo;s service is described in the Supplier&rsquo;s profile on the website which is to be completed by the Supplier&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Service search snippets are searched and displayed based on the Provider&rsquo;s sort algorithm. Customers can also search Profiles according to various criteria, such as:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The category</p>
<p>- The availability</p>
<p>- The pricing</p>
<p>- The location</p>
<p>- The reviews</p>
<p>5. CONTACT BETWEEN SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER</p>
<p>(1) The first contact by the Customer with the Supplier is exclusively through the link supplied on the website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) For this reason, the Supplier may not place on the Profile any of the following: telephone number, email address, physical address or link from the &nbsp;Profile to any other website that is not in the specified field; &nbsp;If the Provider finds that the requirements of this sub-Clause have been breached, the Provider will be entitled to remove any link or reference to a Supplier Website from each Profile immediately, and notify the Supplier by email that this has been done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Once the Supplier has been contacted by a prospective Customer through the link supplied on the Website, the Supplier is free to provide to that prospective Customer any contact details he wishes.</p>
<p>6. PAYMENT, PRICING AND REPORTING.</p>
<p>(1) Supplier shall, in the dashboard specify a maximum number of enquiries he/she wishes to receive. (the&nbsp;"AGREEMENT BUDGET").&nbsp;By indicating an Agreement Budget, Supplier is not committing to spend the Agreement Budget. Supplier is merely notifying Provider that he/she does not wish to exceed the Agreement Budget. Supplier shall remain solely liable to pay sums incurred up to the amount of the Agreement Budget only. Provider and Supplier shall mutually agree the method of payment and record the agreed method in the Supplier Registration. All sums stated in this Agreement are exclusive of VAT unless stated otherwise. Supplier shall pay the sums (including, if applicable, VAT and any other applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity) in the manner dictated by the method of payment agreed between the parties. If payment is not made when due, The Provider may charge a late payment fee of LKR12,000 per annum above the due amount from the due date until the date of actual payment, whether before or after judgment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2)The Provider may change its minimum pricing, if applicable, at any time and Suppliers will be notified of any increase at least thirty (30) days in advance of such increase. Charges shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Provider. Provider shall provide Supplier with password-protected access to 24/7 online reporting information so that Supplier may monitor its account(s). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Provider and only in the form of Supplier enquiry credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Supplier will submit valid credit/debit card details upon registration and keep this information up to date. Supplier card details will not be stored by the Provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) Provider will charge supplier once the supplier has accrued LKR 1,000 worth of spend on Enquiries &amp; URL clicks. Charges that are not disputed within twelve (12) days of the date charge are conclusively deemed accurate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. TERMINATION&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Provider determines, or an allegation is made, that (a) Profile or other content associated with a Supplier contain any material that is deemed false, against the law, applicable regulations or the rights of any person or entity, (b) a Supplier has submitted unsuitable material to, or misused, the site, (c) a Supplier&rsquo;s Profile is unacceptable or unfair. (d) the Supplier is in material breach of these Supplier Ts &amp; Cs or any other obligations owed to the Provider, any Provider Affiliate or Customer, (e) a Supplier has been abusive or offensive to any employee or representative of the Provider, (f) a Supplier uses a false identity, then the Provider shall be entitled to terminate either (i) any affected Profiles, or (ii) all Services associated with such Supplier immediately.&nbsp;A Supplier or Profile that contravenes any of the above requirements shall be in breach of these Supplier Ts &amp; Cs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the Provider assumes no duty to investigate complaints.</p>
<p>8. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PROVIDER&nbsp;</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp;The Provider may occasionally undertake upgrades of the site upgraded in order to address technological developments. Maintenance works are therefore sometimes necessary, which can lead to restrictions on the site. The Provider will, where possible, aim to ensure that maintenance of the site that causes any such restriction is undertaken at a time when most Customers&rsquo; usage is least affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;The Provider also provides an enquiry contact form which serves to send messages from the Customer to the Supplier of the relevant Service. Suppliers acknowledge that unauthorised third parties may misuse such messaging system and unlawfully intercept or read messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Provider is not liable for any such misuse.</p>
<p>(5) The Provider may conduct identity checks and ask for proof to establish the existence of a Service. If the Provider &ndash; including as a result of information provided by Customers - suspects that the Supplier&nbsp;has supplied false information, the Supplier acknowledges that the Provider is entitled to carry out identity checks on the Supplier or to prove the existence of a Service; if requested to do so, the Supplier agrees promptly (and in any event within any period requested by the Provider) to supply to the Provider such proof of identity or of a Service&rsquo;s existence as the Provider requests.&nbsp;Each Supplier acknowledges that failure to comply with any such request constitutes a breach of these&nbsp;Supplier Ts &amp; Cs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(6) The Provider complies with&nbsp;its data protection obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. COPYRIGHT&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;All content that appears on this site, and the site itself, is protected by copyright and database rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproduction of the site, in whole or in part, including the copying of text, graphics or designs, is prohibited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp;Suppliers are required to keep their account login details secret and not to pass them on to third parties. The Provider will never ask Suppliers to disclose this data. If Suppliers are contacted by third parties and asked for login details, under no circumstances should they impart that data, but must immediately notify the Provider of the situation by email through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weddingconnections.lk/contact-wc">Contact Form</a>.

<p>Date: Januray, 2017&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of this website constitutes acceptance of the weddingconnections.lk&nbsp;Terms &amp; Conditions&nbsp;and&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Customer Terms and Conditions</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>These terms and conditions (the &ldquo;Customer Ts &amp; Cs&rdquo;) govern your use of our website. Please read the terms in full before you use this Website. If you do not accept these terms, please do not use this Website. Using the Website implies that you accept these terms. We do occasionally update these terms so please refer back to them in the future.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;THE BASICS</p>
<p>(1) This site is a place where you, the Customer, can view profiles of, and obtain information about, wedding Suppliers registered on our website, and communicate with those Suppliers.</p>
<p>(2) We, the Provider, are not, and do not become, party to any contractual relationship between you, the Customer, and the Suppliers, and do not mediate between the Customer and any of the Suppliers in the event of any dispute arising between you and them. The site is a venue for Suppliers and the Customer to interact.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;SUPPLIER LISTINGS AND INTERACTION WITH SUPPLIERS</p>
<p>(1) Suppliers are entirely responsible for all of the information, including audio and video, images, text and other content, relating to the services they offer (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;), for updating.</p>
<p>(2) If the Customer finds a Supplier in which they are interested, she/he can send an information request to the Supplier (an &ldquo;Request a Quotation&rdquo;) stating their surname, e-mail address and telephone number, and other requested information, without having to log in to the site for the purpose.</p>
<p>(3) The Customer and the Supplier each receive a confirmation from us, the Provider, once an inquiry has been sent to Supplier.</p>
<p>(4) The Supplier may then communicate with the Customer in connection with the enquiry.</p>
<p>(5) The Provider has no responsibility for, or involvement in, the communication between the Supplier and Customer.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PROVIDER</p>
<p>(1) The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that content on the website describing services which Suppliers have submitted to the Provider are as true and accurate a representation of those services as practicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Further, Customers also acknowledge that Suppliers &ndash; and not the Provider &ndash; are responsible for the accuracy with which the content describes the service.</p>
<p>(3) The Provider may occasionally undertake upgrades and maintenance of the site. These works may result in restrictions in the usage on the site. The Provider will, where possible, aim to ensure that works that cause any such restriction are undertaken at a time when most Customers&rsquo; usage is least affected.</p>
<p>(4) The Provider offers a messaging system which may be used by the Supplier and Customer for making contact with one another. Completed enquiry contact forms will be forwarded to the email provided by the Supplier of the relevant service. Customers acknowledge that unauthorised third parties may misuse the system and unlawfully intercept or read messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Provider is not liable for any such misuse.</p>
<p>(5) Each Customer acknowledges that the Provider is not responsible for checking the identity, or for the behaviour, of Suppliers or for establishing the nature, condition or existence of a Service.</p>
<p>(6) The Provider reserves the right to transfer these&nbsp;Customer&nbsp;Ts &amp; Cs, and to assign or subcontract any or all of its rights and obligations under these Customer&nbsp;Ts &amp; Cs, to a third party.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RELATED</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;All content that appears on this site, and the site itself, is protected by copyright and database rights and is owned by us or our Suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproduction of the site, in whole or in part, including the copying of text, graphics, audiovisual content or designs, is prohibited.</p>
<p>(2) Customers are permitted to download and print individual pages of the site provided that you do not modify any content without our consent.</p>
<p>(3) Where a Customer submits to or transmits through the site any content of any type, including text, images and audiovisual content, the Customer undertakes that he/she has the right to do so, and has been granted the necessary consent by any persons featured (&rsquo;model release&rsquo;) or suppliers of featured items (&rsquo;service release&rsquo;).</p>
<p>(4) To the extent that Customers&rsquo; reviews or other content may contain trade marks or other proprietary names or marks, Customers undertake that they have the right to do so.</p>
<p>(5) By submitting reviews to the site, Customers authorise the Provider to use them both on the site and in separately published form.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;CUSTOMERS&rsquo; ACCOUNTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND REVIEWS</p>
<p>(1) Customers must provide only accurate and truthful information concerning their identity in their Accounts and profile pages.</p>
<p>(2) Customers are required to keep their Account login details secret and not to pass them on to third parties. The Provider will never ask Customers to disclose these details. If Customers are contacted by third parties and asked for Account login details, under no circumstances should they impart any of those details, but must immediately notify the Provider of the occurrence through the&nbsp;<a href="http://weddingplanner.co.uk/contact.php"  >Contact Form<img border="0" alt="Contact Form" src="https://www.weddingconnections.lk/components/com_sh404sef/images/external-white.png"/></a>&nbsp;. Should any Customers notice that their account is being used by an unauthorised third party, they should immediately report the matter to the Provider through the&nbsp;<a href="http://weddingplanner.co.uk/contact.php"  >Contact Form<img border="0" alt="Contact Form" src="https://www.weddingconnections.lk/components/com_sh404sef/images/external-white.png"/></a>&nbsp;and change their password.</p>
<p>(3) Messages sent via the Provider&rsquo;s messaging system should only relate to serious booking enquiries. It is prohibited to misuse the Provider&rsquo;s messaging system, such as by sending unsolicited commercial communications (spam). The Customer must not misuse the site&rsquo;s email, messaging or social sharing features. Emails, messages or social sharing features, including recommendations through the "Request for Quotation" option, may be sent out only with the recipient's consent.</p>
<p>(4) Customers may post their reviews of Suppliers&rsquo; Services (&ldquo;Latest User Reviews&rdquo;) on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplier is given the opportunity to view Customer Reviews, and to respond to them (a &ldquo;Supplier Response&rdquo;).</p>
<p>(5) Please note that the Provider does not, and does not realistically have the ability to, verify the accuracy or otherwise of comments, Customer Reviews or Supplier Responses.</p>
<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Provider nevertheless requires all Comments, Customer Reviews and Supplier Responses to be written by by the customer who has booked the service or his/her authorized representative, and may decline to post any of them that the Provider finds does not do so.</p>
<p>(7) In the event that any Customer Review appears on the site but fails to be accurate, then without prejudice to any other available remedies, the Provider shall be entitled immediately to remove from the site the relevant non-conforming Customer Review.</p>
<p>(8) The Provider does not generally conduct identity checks. If Customers suspect that the Supplier has supplied false information, they are invited to notify the Provider through the&nbsp;<a href="http://weddingplanner.co.uk/contact.php"  >Contact Form<img border="0" alt="Contact Form" src="https://www.weddingconnections.lk/components/com_sh404sef/images/external-white.png"/></a>.</p>

Suppliers generally authorise the Provider to forward the Supplier&rsquo;s contact details, including telephone number, to Customers in connection with a Service booking.
